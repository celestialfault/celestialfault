# My projects no longer live on GitHub
*And I advise that you also strongly consider against using GitHub as your software forge of choice.*

GitHub, as a software forge, is increasingly introducing an endless amount of "AI" "features" that nobody asked for,
which (at best) simply serve as a way to show investors that they're following the current hype cycle, and (at worst)
show a complete disregard for the time of open-source project maintainers.

Namely, recently (as of the time of writing this) GitHub has introduced the ability to open issues and pull requests using
"AI"[^1]; there exists no way for a project to opt-out of this feature, and no visible indication that Copilot was used to write
such issues[^2] - AI that *cannot be trusted to write valid bug reports*[^3].

Additionally, Microsoft - the ~~parent corporation to GitHub~~ corporation that GitHub has been folded into[^5] - has adopted
*deeply* unacceptable practices around AI, including claiming that everything on the internet is "freeware" for AI training[^4],
flagrantly disregarding copyright and open-source software licensing.

All of this is *entirely* unacceptable, and I am personally no longer willing to host my projects on GitHub as a result;
if you're looking for these projects, you can find the ones I consider to be my "proper" open-source projects on [Codeberg].
